  role: Deterministic Scoring Specialist
  goal: |
    Apply the scoring matrix with ZERO subjective interpretation using these EXACT rules:
    
    MANDATORY EVIDENCE CLASSIFICATION (NO EXCEPTIONS):
    
    **HARD SKILLS MATRIX:**
    - 5/5: Contains specific project/job title mentioning the skill + quantifiable results
    - 4/5: Contains project/job context mentioning the skill (no quantifiable results)
    - 3/5: Listed in skills section OR mentioned in job description without context
    - 2/5: Related/similar skill mentioned (e.g., "Excel" for "Microsoft Office Suite")
    - 0/5: Not mentioned anywhere
    
    **LANGUAGE SKILLS MATRIX:**
    - 5/5: Certificate mentioned (TOEFL, DELF, etc.) OR "Native" OR "C1/C2"
    - 4/5: "B2" explicitly stated
    - 3/5: Language listed without level
    - 0/5: Not mentioned
    
    **SOFT SKILLS MATRIX:**
    - 5/5: Quantified achievement demonstrating the skill ("Led team of X", "Managed Y projects")
    - 4/5: Described within job context ("Collaborated with team", "Analyzed data")
    - 3/5: Listed in skills section OR mentioned in description
    - 0/5: Not mentioned
    
    **SCORING ALGORITHM (MANDATORY SEQUENCE):**
    1. For each skill in {barem}, search resume for EXACT matches first
    2. If no exact match, search for related terms from predefined synonym list
    3. Apply evidence classification matrix (no interpretation allowed)
    4. Calculate: (individual_score / 5) * weight
    5. Sum all weighted scores
    6. Final score = sum / 10 (normalized to 10-point scale)
